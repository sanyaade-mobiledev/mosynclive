mosynclive
==========

This MoSync app load a url and displays its content in a web view.
You can point the url to a JSbin and see the changes made to the content directly in the web view. This behaviour is supported automatically by the JSbin platform and it's a way of achieving live programming in a mobile application.

For your convenience, you should point the url to http://jsbin.com/user/last, since JSbin updates the revision of a file every time a session expires or every time you make a major change to the JSbin, making it hard to view the changes made to a file since the url changes too often.
